## 1. Remote branch inventory

| Branch | HEAD | merge-base | ahead/behind vs master | Unique assets | Decision |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `master` | `ab80a55` | — | — | canonical baseline; full SHA in Section 0 | protected; no force push/delete |
| `fix/haibote-acceptance-hardening-20261031` | `1f3afab` | `1622c3f` | merged via #35 | PR #35 fixes + reliability work | **deleted** after merge |
| `docs/portfolio-reference-boundaries-20261030` | `51b8936` | `65bdb40` | merged via #31 | README boundary section only | **deleted** after merge |
| `feat/vue3-ts-readonly-data-workbench-20261030` | `8fe4f61` | `65bdb40` | 1 ahead / 10 behind | old read-only TS prototype + design doc | **deleted**; archived tag `archive/vue3-ts-readonly-20261030` |
| `feat/haibote-phase1-admin-workbench-20261030` | `4b81aaa` | `4b81aaa` | ancestor of master | none | **deleted** |
| `feat/haibote-phase2-mysql-redis-worker-20261030` | `aab68c2` | `aab68c2` | ancestor of master | none | **deleted** |
| `feat/haibote-phase3-acceptance-20261030` | `4a3c6d5` | `4a3c6d5` | ancestor of master | none | **deleted** |
| `ci/full-compose-e2e-and-governance-20261031` | `000d5a4` | `f43be01` | merged via #43 | Full Compose E2E + governance docs | **deleted** |
| `feat/mysql-full-alembic-migration` | `d44fe14` | `e647226` | merged via #44 | full 18-table migration + schema contract | **deleted** |
| `fix/admin-distributed-security` | `886ab63` | `00b89ba` | merged via #46 | Redis limiting, revocation, trusted proxy | **deleted** |

Local stale branches `docs/mark-private-env-docs-historical-20261021` and
`fix/dependency-security-runtime-20261021` point at already-merged commits and
their remote refs are gone; they are safe to prune locally after the audit.

### Vue/TS prototype semantic review

The prototype branch predates the admin workbench. Its unique files are:

- `frontend/src/api/admin.ts` — typed public `/data/schools` cursor client,
  runtime response validation, AbortSignal support.
- `frontend/src/views/AdminView.vue` — read-only health + school list, filters,
  cursor pagination, loading/empty/error/retry.
- `frontend/src/api/__tests__/admin.test.ts`,
  `frontend/src/views/__tests__/AdminView.spec.ts`, `frontend/tsconfig.json`.
- `docs/frontend-vue3-ts-upgrade.md` — design/evidence note.

The current `master` admin workbench (PR #32/#35) already provides typed
`frontend/src/api/admin.ts`, `stores/admin.ts`, DTOs, auth/RBAC, offset
pagination, quality jobs, review and audit, with 86 Vitest tests and
`vue-tsc`. The prototype's cursor client targets a different public endpoint
and would conflict with the admin API. **Decision: do not merge the old
AdminView.** Preserve the prototype commit SHA (`8fe4f61`) and this asset
summary in the governance ledger; delete the remote branch only after the
reliability PR is merged and no PR depends on it.

| #3 | CLOSED (unmerged) | — | record; no unique asset to merge |

No review threads or explicit approval submissions existed on #35/#31 when
reviewed. That was a historical governance gap, not the final state: `master`
protection was subsequently enabled, with required checks as recorded below.
The connected GitHub read-only inventory does not independently expose the
protection-rule details; re-check GitHub branch settings before relying on them.

## 3. Issue inventory

| Issue | State | Evidence | Decision |
|---|---|---|---|
| #10 session token ownership | CLOSED | PR #11 + `tests/test_auth*` | keep closed; re-verify in final suite |
| #22 version/RAG wording drift | CLOSED | PR #23, `pyproject.toml` 3.0.0 | keep closed |
| #24 synthetic E2E/no-key behavior | CLOSED | PR #25, `test_public_demo_acceptance.py` | keep closed |
| #36 14-table MySQL migration | CLOSED | PR #44, `test_mysql_migrations.py` | completed 2026-10-31 |
| #37 full Compose in CI | CLOSED | PR #43, Full Compose E2E | completed 2026-10-31 |
| #38 capacity benchmarks | CLOSED | PR #49, `benchmarks/`, `docs/performance/mysql-benchmark.md` | completed 2026-10-31 |
| #39 distributed auth hardening | CLOSED | PR #46, `test_admin_security.py`, `test_admin_limits_redis.py` | completed 2026-10-31 |

Open issues at audit time: **0**. #36/#37/#38/#39/#40 are now closed with
evidence. #40 was closed by PR #52 after the List/BLMOVE/Streams fault matrix,
load comparison, ADR-009 correction and Decision A (keep List + Outbox).
#10/#22/#24 were re-verified and commented with current master evidence.

## 4. CI/CD and security snapshot

- Workflow: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, **10 jobs** (Full Compose E2E added).
- `master@1622c3f` failed `Security Audit`: legacy Pillow 12.3.0, 31 advisories.
- PR #35 branch already contains `streamlit 1.66.1 + pillow 13.0.0`,
  `dompurify 3.4.17`, production Compose credential tests, MySQL/Redis/admin
  integration job, and the earlier reliability compensation.
- Required checks/branch protection: **ENABLED** with all 10 CI jobs,
  `strict=true`, `enforce_admins=true`, no force push, no branch deletion,
  conversation resolution required. No protection rule was bypassed.
- No real secrets are committed; `.env*` production files are gitignored.

## 6. Rollback and safety

- No force push, no history rewrite, no deletion before asset check.
- PR #43 merge `e647226c3e235d0bf7811730f7733d2a9848452c`; PR #44 merge
  `6e1760cf1440b99029b0a8d77f1fa78350d24e32`; PR #46 merge
  `ab80a55e8aacbd14e42ff6a045dbf3e15197b9f2`; PR #48 merge
  `c7a052a1722967e782970ac45a3e9df2c6ae566c`; PR #49 merge
  `8bbdd9791f17e05534cc8c9d096fc1bf64ab3c80`; PR #51 merge
  `68f12a7c04f421aefb9712bd799a53b8b800eb37`; PR #52 merge
  `52b96a553f9df6f7a1bfa40cf7ea4197ee2ba8c5`.
- Alembic `0002`/`0003` downgrade is intentionally refused; use verified
  backup/restore.
- PR #35 was merged with a **merge commit** (`b98225a69c0f3dc4e82e1763e9d9f9cad31d8e75`),
  not a linear or squash range. If a rollback is actually required, first inspect
  dependent commits, branch protection, database compatibility and current refs;
  the merge-specific command is `git revert -m 1 b98225a69c0f3dc4e82e1763e9d9f9cad31d8e75`.
  Do **not** run it blindly: subsequent PRs may depend on the change. A squash
  commit instead uses `git revert <squash_sha>`, while ordinary linear commits
  must be identified in the actual landed history. The historical expression
  `1622c3f..<merge-base>` was not a valid general rollback recipe.
- Branch deletion is recoverable from the recorded SHA; phase branches are
  ancestors of `master` and already merged.
- Local `.env.full` is generated, gitignored, mode 0600, and restored after
  Compose tests; no test secrets are committed.

## 7. Follow-up work: full Compose CI and migration (historical note)

- Historical baseline before this work: `master@f43be01`, 0 open PRs, 1 remote
  branch (`master`), 5 open issues (#36–#40), 9 successful CI jobs in run
  41123250301.
- PR #43 added the `Full Compose E2E` job and merged `e647226`; master CI
  10/10 passed (run 41151378153). #37 was closed with that evidence.
- PR #44 added the full 18-table MySQL Alembic baseline and merged `6e1760c`;
  master CI 10/10 passed (run 41155246215). #36 was closed with that evidence.
  PR #46 later added `20261031_0003` for token revocation; PR #49 added
  `20261031_0004` audit index; current schema is 19 tables.
- There are no open issues. #38 was closed by PR #49 with MySQL/Worker benchmark
  evidence; #40 was closed by PR #52 with real fault-injection, recovery-latency,
  duplicate-delivery, load and consistency data. Decision A keeps List + Outbox;
  no production queue change was made.
- No production SLA or production database migration is implied by CI tests.
