# Data license and provenance

## Dataset in this repository

`scripts/seed_demo_data.py` generates the entire dataset shipped with this demo.

* **Type:** synthetic, machine-generated, deterministic (seed `20240617`)
* **License:** CC0-1.0
* **Contains:** no real institution, programme, score, rank or policy data
* **Markers:** institution names carry `（合成）`; provinces are invented
  (`示例省·甲`…); the `schools.special_type` column carries
  `SYNTHETIC_DEMO_DATA`

Regenerate with:

```bash
python -m scripts.seed_demo_data --db data/demo.db --reset
```

## Synthetic knowledge corpus

`knowledge/synthetic_demo/` is the knowledge corpus that ships with the demo.

* **Type:** original, machine-authored, synthetic (no source text reused)
* **License:** CC0-1.0
* **Contains:** fictional institution rules, illustrative admission-policy
  examples, volunteer-application FAQ and explanatory notes
* **Markers:** every `groups/*.md` file starts with a `SYNTHETIC_DEMO` notice;
  `manifest.json` records the corpus marker, licence, version and per-file
  sha256 hashes; institution names carry `（合成）` and match
  `scripts/seed_demo_data.py`
* **Not included:** the upstream persona-methodology group, any quotation
  collection, or any real admission policy/data

`server/services/rag.py::validate_corpus` refuses to serve a corpus that does
not carry the `SYNTHETIC_DEMO` marker, so an unmarked or rights-unclear corpus
cannot silently masquerade as demo knowledge.

## Historical commit caveat

The statements above describe the **current tree only**. A historical database
object is still reachable through an older public Git commit; it is not
synthetic and is not covered by the CC0 grant. The open, redacted remediation
record is [Issue #58](https://github.com/Xander-Xai/gaobao-advisor/issues/58).
Nothing in this licence grants rights to that historical object or to any
third-party admissions data.

## What is deliberately NOT here

The upstream private project contained a knowledge corpus and a quotation
collection attributed to a named individual, plus production database backups.
None of it is redistributed here. See README "RAG 能力" and "安全规则资产".

If you add a corpus, you must be able to state its licence and provenance and
must enable RAG only after that corpus passes the integrity check.
