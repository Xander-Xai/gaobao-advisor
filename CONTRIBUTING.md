# Contributing

Contributions are welcome for engineering quality, safety and
reproducibility. Contributions that reintroduce restricted content are not.

## Hard constraints

1. **No real data.** Everything shipped must be synthetic or demonstrably
   redistributable. `tests/test_public_demo_acceptance.py` enforces this against
   git-tracked files and must stay green.
2. **No unlicensed third-party content.** Do not add quotation corpora,
   knowledge bases, prompt libraries or personas you cannot show permission for.
   The upstream private project's corpus and a named individual's methodology /
   quotation assets were removed for this reason and must not be restored.
3. **Disabled means disabled.** If a subsystem is unavailable, expose that
   state rather than returning an empty-but-successful result.
   See `server/services/rag.py` and `tests/test_g9_retrieval.py`.
4. **Fail closed on safety assets.** Removing `skills/gaokao/safety_rules.md`
   must disable answer generation, not silently drop the rules.
5. **No outbound scraping by default.** `legacy/gaokao_data.py` must not call a
   third-party site unless `ENABLE_OUTBOUND_FETCH` is explicitly enabled.

## Development

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"            # or: pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txt
python -m scripts.seed_demo_data --db data/demo.db --reset
pytest tests -q --no-header
ruff check . && ruff format --check .

cd frontend && npm ci && npx vitest run && npx vite build
```

The runtime dependency set is `requirements.txt` / `requirements.lock`; it must
have **zero known vulnerabilities** and CI enforces it with `pip-audit`. Do not
add a dependency to it without running `make audit-deps` — and check
[`docs/dependency-exceptions.md`](docs/dependency-exceptions.md) first, because
some packages are deliberately kept out of the runtime (see the policy there).

The optional legacy Streamlit operations dashboard has its own dependency file
and is never installed by default:

```bash
make install-legacy-admin   # pip install -r requirements-legacy-admin.txt
make run                    # streamlit run legacy/admin.py
```

CI runs on Python 3.10 and 3.11, plus a frontend gate, a secret scan, a
no-key container smoke test and a redistribution gate.
